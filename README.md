### Introduction
The Devils River is a single stream segment that flows in south-central Texas to the confluence of the Rio Grande. Many moderate to large springs discharge from the Cretaceous Edwards-Trinity Plateau Aquifer (ETPA), giving the Devils River one of the larges base flows of Texas' rivers (Brune, 1981). Low flows of the river are governed by these groundwater inputs, while frontal and convective storms during monsoon drive high flows (URG BBEST, 2012).  
>The Devils is recognized as one of the most pristine aquatic systems in the state and is often considered the paradigm for surface water quality in Texas (URG BBEST, 2012).  

However, the diminishing flow of the river has reached an extent that the natural and cultural resources of the Devils and Rio Grande have become greatly impacted. In recent history, the Devils' remote location and hostile environment limited pollution from human and animal populations. It is a concern that drought, increased population and increased groundwater pumping of the ETPA has directly affected and reduced spring and river flow in the Devils River and throughout the west Texas region.
### Objectives
Objectives to be addressed include: 
* Geochemical analysis to identify water-rock interactions, recharge elevation, and age of spring water
* Identification and importance of geologic and structural features and how they control groundwater flow paths
* Spring influence on water quality and quantity
### Methods
* Gain/Loss Surveys

  Stream discharge was measured at seven locations within the study area. Discharge (Q) is the volume of water downstream per unit of time and is commonly expressed in cubic meters per second (cms), or cubic feet per second (cfs). It is computed by multiplying the area of water in a channel cross section by the average velocity of the water in the cross section:
<p align="center">Q = Area * Velocity</p>

* Water Chemistry

  Surface and groundwater samples were collected at each discharge measurement location and each visible and accessible spring along the Devils River to establish groundwater influence on surface water chemistry, rock-water interactions, groundwater ages and flow paths, and recharge processes. Both surface and groundwater samples were collected for major ion and isotopic analysis. Additional groundwater samples were collected for noble gas, tritium, and radiocarbon dating analysis.  

  _Cation and Anion Analysis_  
  Surface and groundwater samples for major cation and anion analysis were collected at each discharge measurement location and spring sampling location. Cations analyzed include ammonium, barium, calcium, lithium, magnesium, manganese, potassium, and sodium. Anions analyzed include bromide, chloride, fluoride, nitrate, nitrite, phosphate, and sulfate.
  
  _Stable Isotope Analysis_  
  Water samples for deuterium-hydrogen (&delta;<sup>2</sup>H) and oxygen (&delta;<sup>18</sup>O) isotopes were collected at ion sampling locations. Isotopic analyses calculated molecular concentrations of <sup>2</sup>HHO, HH<sup>18</sup>O, and HHO. These molecular concentrations are coverted to atomic ratios <sup>2</sup>H/<sup>1</sup>H and <sup>18</sup>O/<sup>16</sup>O and a post-processing procedure is used to calculate delta-scale (&delta;) values with respect to Vienna Standard Mean Ocean Water (VSMOW).
  
  _Noble Gas Analysis_  
  Groundwater samples for noble gas included analysis for argon, krpton, xenon, neon, helium, and radon.
  
  _Tritium Analysis_  
  Groundwater samples collected for tritium (T or 3H) analysis provides a means to accurately date when groundwater was recharged. 
  
  _Radiocarbon Analysis_  
  Groundwater samples were collected at each spring for radiocarbon analysis. Results of the analysis were presented as apparent age, the carbon-13 value, and best estimate age. The apparent age gives the simple measurement age of groundwater prior to carbon dilution correction and is expressed as:  
<p align="center">t = -8035 ln (&delta;C14<sub>final</sub>/&delta;C14<sub>initial</sub>)</p>  
    
###### &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where:  
###### &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;t = radiocarbon age of the sample  
###### &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;8035 = the decay constant of radiocarbon, i.e., the half-life divided by ln 2. A half-life of 5568 years of carbon 14 is used  
###### &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;per international convention  
###### &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ln = the natural logarithm  
###### &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&delta;C14<sub>final</sub> = the measured net radiocarbon content of sample  
###### &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&delta;C14<sub>initial</sub> = the net radiocarbon content of the modern sample  
  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The carbon-13 age is used for the estimation of the carbon dilution factor, leading to a corrected age, or best estimate  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;age. The best estimate age is only intended to present easily visualized results. The apparent age is the best reference  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and is used for all comparison studies.
